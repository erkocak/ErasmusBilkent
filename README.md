# CS319-Erasmus-Project / Group Name: GO:CS

ErasmusBilkent is a web-based Erasmus Application Manager software. This software is intended to digitalise all Erasmus applications on an online platform and to eliminate manual check processes such as e-mails and paper forms. After the early placement for the program, the website is planned to be used by incoming/outgoing students, department coordinators, instructors, and the exchange office. 
 
This application will be functional after the Erasmus applications are made through the Erasmus Application app. After the applications and the first checks are made, students are expected to continue their application through the ErasmusBilkent app. In this app, all parties are going to be able to see students’ total points which are calculated and listed by the application along with a ranking of those students within their departments. The placement of students to their preferred universities will be made according to their priority choices and students’ total points. After the first-round placement to the universities, the students that haven’t been placed to a university will be taken to the waitlist if they want to. This is in case someone renounces their placement, and another student who hasn’t yet been placed will replace the renouncing student.
 
When the nomination time comes, the department coordinators and Yelda Hanım (administrative) will nominate the students to the partner universities. The students will be sent a registration form by these universities through email, and in the meantime, they will be expected to fill out the pre-approval form on the Bilkent Erasmus. If there’s a must-course the students are planning to take at the partner institution, they will have to upload this course’s syllabus to ErasmusBilkent and direct it to the instructor of that course. The instructor will accept or reject the course as an equal to the one at the home institution. If the must-course at a given institution has already been taken by another student in previous years, the course will already be on the previously-taken courses database, so the student won’t have to have the course reapproved.
 
Considering the description of ErasmusBilkent above, key features of this software include:
 
- Different rights, responsibilities and available features for different type of users
- Digitalised communication between parties
- Status control for the Erasmus applicants (students)
- Todo list (provided for Coordinators)
- Distribution of workload among coordinators
- Approved/rejected course (previously-taken) information
- Course transfer operations
- Storage and access (query support) for documents
 
In general, this application will be useful for minimizing the paperwork and mailing coordinators by providing better document communication tools. Also, students will be able to track their application processes more easily. Access to course details, documents and operations will also be provided to students for a better, accelerated experience. Application will not only benefit the outgoing/incoming Erasmus students, but also systematically reduce the workload of coordinators, instructors and administratives. Overall, ErasmusBilkent web application aims to support every user who is involved in the Erasmus application process by providing practical solutions.
